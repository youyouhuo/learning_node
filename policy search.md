truely random search:



population-based:
  Population-based BBO methods manage a limited population of individuals, and generate new individuals randomly in the vicinity of the previous elite individuals.
  
Evolutionary strategies:
  Evolutionary strategies (ES) can be seen as specific population-based optimization methods where only one individual is retained from one generation to the next. More specifically, an optimum guess is computed from the previous samples, then the next samples are obtained by adding Gaussian noise to the current optimum guess.
