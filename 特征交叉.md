  >> * Deep & Cross Network for Ad Click Predictions
  >>> the small number of parameters of the cross network has limited the model capacity. To capture highly nonlinear interactions,
we introduce a deep network in parallel
  >>>
  >>> Adam optimizer、 batch size is set at 512、Batch normalization was applied to the deep network 、 gradient clip norm
was set at 100、used early stopping， as we did not find L2 regularization or dropout to be effective
