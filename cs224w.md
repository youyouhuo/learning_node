## lecture 3.2  random walk approaches for node embeddings
  - notation
    vector z<sub>u</sub>:
      the embedding of node u(what we aim to find)
  - probability p(v|z<sub>u</sub> ) :our model prediction based on z<sub>u</sub>
      the The (predicted) probability of visiting node  v on random walks starting from node u.
